SELECT COUNT(Heroin) As Heroin_involved, COUNT(Heroin_death_certificate__DC_) AS On_death_certificate
FROM Drug.deaths;
 
-- same query result but it appeals to the Heroin and Heroin_death_certificate__DC_ columns which are BOOLEAN data types. 

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN Heroin = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Heroin_involved,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Heroin_death_certificate__DC_ = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS On_death_certificate
